## Moti 


Moti is a powerful animation library specifically designed for React Native and Expo. It offers a declarative syntax and a variety of features to simplify animation development and enhance the user experience of your apps:

- **Declarative Syntax:** Define animations using JavaScript objects, similar to CSS, making your code cleaner and easier to manage.

- **Pre-built Animations:** Leverage pre-built animations like `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, `scale`, `rotate`, and many more to save development time.

- **Customizable Animations:** Create custom animations for complex requirements using timing functions, easing functions, and interpolation for granular control.

- **Performance Optimization:** Moti is built with performance in mind, delivering smooth animations even on low-end devices.

- **Gesture Integration:** Seamlessly integrate Moti with React Native gestures to create interactive animations that respond to user input, such as touch or device motion.

**Benefits:**

- **Simplified Animation Development:** Easier to implement smooth and engaging animations.
- **Improved User Experience:** Enhances user experience with visual cues and a more responsive feel.
- **Increased Maintainability:** Declarative animations are generally easier to maintain and understand.

## Expo Router 2

Expo Router 2 is a navigation library specifically built for Expo apps, offering several advantages for developing single-page applications (SPAs):

- **SPA-like Navigation:** Provides a seamless navigation experience similar to web applications, transitioning between screens without reloading the entire app.

- **Declarative Configuration:**  Define your app's navigation routes using a declarative syntax for improved code clarity and management.

- **Deep Linking Support:** Enables deep linking functionality, allowing users to navigate to specific screens in your app from external sources like emails or web pages.

- **Expo-Specific Enhancements:** Takes advantage of Expo's native modules and services for a smooth integration experience within the Expo environment.


## @gorhom/bottom-sheet: Interactive Bottom Sheets for React Native

This library provides a powerful and flexible way to implement bottom sheets in your React Native applications. Bottom sheets are UI elements that slide up from the bottom of the screen, offering a convenient way to display additional options or content.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive Gestures:** Control how users interact with the sheet using gestures like dragging up/down to open/close and snapping to specific positions.
- **Customizable Appearance:** Tailor the look and feel of the sheet through props like background color, header, and initial position.
- **Multi-Level Support:** Create nested bottom sheets for complex interactions within your app.
- **Declarative API:** Define bottom sheet behavior and customization using intuitive props.

**Benefits:**

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provide a user-friendly and intuitive way to access additional functionality.
- **Improved Layout Efficiency:** Keep primary content readily accessible while offering secondary options through the bottom sheet.
- **Flexibility and Customization:** Adapt the bottom sheet to match your app's design and interaction requirements.
